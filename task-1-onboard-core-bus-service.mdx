## Overview

This page provides guidance on how to work with MCSP platform core business services.

There are two YAML files required to board the platform:

1. The `Product registration YAML` that defines how the platform identifies your product once it is deployed. This includes identity, metering, access & user management, and other business-focused functions.
2. The `Common Service broker YAML` that defines the product's service broker that is used for service instance lifecycle events (service provision, deprovsion, update).

You are required to maintain both of these documents within a `git` repository on `github.acme.com`. Changes to these is managed with a Gitops process. Updates to these YAML files, drive changes in the platform Core Business Service runtime. ArgoCD is used to push updates to a git repository and the changes automatically trigger a build, updating the runtime to make the changes effective. The build process works across three environments: `dev`, `staging`, and `production`. Based on how you configure ArgoCD, you can control when changes get pushed to each of these environments.

The following is a cookbook for how to author basic versions of these YAML files and how to deploy a simple ArgoCD-based pipeline to push your product to these environments. These are meant to be examplesâ€”you can change and modify them to meet your specific project needs. However, this should get you started.

## Step 1: Configure Product Registration CR

Refer to [Onboarding to Product Registration](./task-1a-onboard-product-registration) for details on how to start with a sample template and associated values file and generate your own product registration too get started.

## Step 2: Configure Common Service Broker CR

Refer to [Onboarding to CSB](./task-1b-onboard-csb) for details on how to create a simple service broker and enable it with the platform common service broker.

## Step 3: Set Up ArgoCD Integration for delivering CR files

Refer to [Using ArgoCD to deliver configuration](./task-1c-argocd) for details on how to create a simple service broker and enable it with the platform common service broker.

## Next Steps

Once you have finished onboarding to core business services, proceed to the [Onboarding to Platform IAM](./task-2-onboard-iam) to continue your integration.
