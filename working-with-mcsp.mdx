## Overview
This page provides guidance on how to work with MCSP backend services.

Working with MCSP involves maintaining and updating two YAML documents:

1. The _product registration YAML_ that defines how MCSP tracks your product once it is deployed for a customer. This includes metering, user management, and other business-focused functions.
2. The _common service broker YAML_ that defines how MCSP spins up your product for a customer. This covers deployment, logging, monitoring, and other infrastructure-focused functions.

You should maintain both of these documents within a `git` repository on `github.acme.com`.

Once you have both YAML files, you can trigger MCSP with them. The preferred way to do this is to use ArgoCD to watch the git repository for changes to the YAML files and trigger a build whenever the content changes. This build process will update MCSP to make the changes effective. The build process works across three environments: `dev`, `staging`, and `production`. Based on how you configure ArgoCD, you can control when changes get pushed to each of these environments.

The following is a cookbook for how to author basic versions of these YAML files and how to deploy a simple ArgoCD-based pipeline to push your product to these environments. These are meant to be examplesâ€”you can change and modify them to meet your specific project needs. However, this should get you started.

## Step 1: Configure Product Registration

_This section will describe how to set up and configure a simple default product registration YAML file._

## Step 2: Set Up ArgoCD Integration

_This section will explain how to configure ArgoCD to automatically deploy changes to your product registration._

## Next Steps
Once you understand how to work with MCSP, proceed to the [main task list](/) to begin implementation.
