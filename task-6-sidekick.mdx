## Overview

Sidekick is a reusable web component provided by the platform and delivered via a CDN. This guide walks you through the integration process, including installation, usage, and configuration options. By the end, you’ll have Sidekick running in your application with minimal setup.

### 1. Install / Include the Component

Add the Platform Menu web component to your application by including the script from the CDN:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script
      type="module"
      src="https://cdn.dev.saas.acme.com/solis_ui/v1/sidekick/solis-sidekick.es.js"
    ></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

### 2. Install / Include the Component

Embed the menu component into your application:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <!-- Your application content here -->

      <solis-sidekick
        correlation_id="Quote of the Day"
        title="Quote of the Day"
        context="application"
        product="instana"
      />
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
