title: "Task 4: Implement the Login Button"
---

## Overview

The `login button` renders information about the currently logged in user along with several optional links to platform services such as the platform provided user & access management UI for products that use this service for their service users. There is also an optional `Logout` option which will re-direct the browser to the platform authentication service requesting the user's session cookie be invalidated.

Products that support allowing an unauthenticated user to access their UI may choose to enable the `Login` option here after the user is logged out.

[TODO: more details with links to supporting js file for this]

## Next Steps

Once the login button is implemented, proceed to [Platform menu](./task-5-platform-menu) and [Data access layer](./task-5a-mcp-service).
